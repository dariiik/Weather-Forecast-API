# Weather-Forecast-API
A web-application that was built through JavaScript and Django Framework using Web API. The development lifecycle was build using Scrum Agile Framework. Conducted testing using Atheris Fuzzing engine.


I implemented API using JavaScript and Django. Django was used for server-side API implementation and JavaScript for the client-side. 

Note: HTML and CSS are both source codes from another developer! I implemented only the API and did some Backend development, and also conducted Fuzz testing.
